## What is it?

This site has the goal to list all the new airing/streaming anime in Japan, and which subs groups are subbing (or plan to sub) them.

## Is there an API?

It's not really an API.
Our website hosts `JSON` files to load our `HTML` files content.

You can find more information on the [`FansubDB/data` project](https://github.com/FansubDB/data/blob/master/README.md) or on the [`FansubDB/data` website](https://fansubdb.github.io/data/)

## I want to help you.

No problem.
